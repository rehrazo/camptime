CoolerPak is refillable, reusable and space-saving. When not in use, drain and pack it away. CoolerPak is universally designed to work with all coolers. Ditch messy ice and bulky packs for an efficient, eco-friendly cooling upgrade. Enjoy fresh food and beverages on all your adventures with CoolerPak.<br />Each CoolerPak includes a bonus Snap Screw Kit. To install, simply attach the included paper template to the cooler wall and use a hand screwdriver to secure the screws at the marked mounting points. However, if you prefer not to use the snap screws, the CoolerPak snap to each other and can form their own freestanding walls.<br /><br />Universally compatible, CoolerPak works seamlessly with any cooler that accommodates its size, ensuring a perfect fit and optimal performance.<br />The ice that melts inside CoolerPak is potable water and is safe to drink! Please note that the water added before freezing needs to be potable water. Instead of needing to pack both ice and water for your cooler, those that are tight on space can consider the Coolerpak as an alternative water option.<br />Crafted from 600D TPU flexible fabric, CoolerPak is built to withstand rugged outdoor adventures while maintaining its cooling capabilities. <br />We put CoolerPak to the test with a 10lb CoolerPak in a 30qt cooler.
